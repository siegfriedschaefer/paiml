started to develop cryptotap as a concept in rust.

## structs and associated functions

Struct
A custom data type in Rust that allows you to package together and name multiple related values, similar to objects in other languages. Fields in a struct can have different types.

Implementation (impl)
A Rust keyword used to define methods and associated functions for a struct or enum, allowing you to add behavior to these types. Used to create constructors and instance methods.

Associated Function
A function defined within an impl block that doesn’t take self as a parameter. Often used to create constructors (like ‘new()’) for structs. Called using the struct name and double colon syntax.

Field
A named value within a struct that holds data of a specific type. Fields can be accessed using dot notation and must be initialized when creating a new struct instance.

Constructor
A conventional associated function (usually named ‘new’) that creates and returns a new instance of a struct with default or specified values. Provides a clean way to instantiate structs.

Tuple Struct
A struct variant that defines a type with unnamed fields, accessed by index rather than field names. Useful when you need a distinct type but don’t need named fields.

Ownership
A fundamental Rust concept where each value has a single owner, ensuring memory safety without garbage collection. When a value is passed to a function, ownership transfers unless explicitly borrowed.

Option Type
A Rust enum that represents either Some(value) or None, used for values that might not exist. Commonly used in struct fields that might not have a value.

Debug Attribute
A special attribute (#[derive(Debug)]) that can be added to structs to enable printing of their contents for debugging purposes using the {:?} format specifier.
