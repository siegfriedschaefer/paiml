We want to build a Crypto Beer Pub Fabric which someone can use for sell virtual beer and
use it as a social location.

## Pint sizes

Pint (20 Imperial fluid ounces, 568 ml)
This is the most common and iconic size for serving draught beer in English pubs. It's the standard measure for most ales, lagers, and stouts.

Half Pint (10 Imperial fluid ounces, 284 ml)
Also very common, the half pint is often chosen by those who want a smaller drink, are trying different beers, or prefer a less potent serving.

Third of a Pint (6.67 Imperial fluid ounces, ~189 ml)
Increasingly popular, especially for trying a wider variety of beers or stronger, more flavourful brews. Often served in "taster" glasses or as part of a flight.
